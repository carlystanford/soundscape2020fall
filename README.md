For my final draft of my soundscape narrative, which is titled "Kitchen Chronicles," I pretty much completely
changed up my original concept. I found that I was running into issues with my original idea, specifically the idea of exploring different cultures and the sounds associated with them- to make it sound realistic, I likely would've
had to use voices of other languages, and I don't speak any other languages nor do I know anyone who does, and it would've been too difficult to source them from other places online. I wanted to still do something related to cooking and sounds from the kitchen, so I decided to instead document someone's journey as a subpar cook in attempting to cook a good dish. It starts with a conversation between the main character and a friend, and this conversation introduces the idea that the main character wants to improve their cooking skills. Their friend tells them just to try a recipe they find online, and the main character decides to take
the next day to attempt it. After a long day in the kitchen, the friend comes over to try the food and deliver the final verdict.
