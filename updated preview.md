For this draft of my soundscape narrative, I pretty much completely
changed up my original concept. I found that I was running
into issues with my original idea, specifically the idea
of exploring different cultures and the sounds associated
with them- to make it sound realistic, I likely would've
had to use voices of other languages, and I don't speak any
other languages nor do I know anyone who does, and it would've been
too difficult to source them from other places online. I wanted to still
do something related to cooking and sounds from the kitchen, so I decided to instead
document someone's journey as a subpar cook in attempting to
cook a good dish, and ultimately failing. It starts with
a conversation between the main character and a friend, and
this conversation introduces the idea that the main character
wants to improve their cooking skills. Their friend tells them just to
try a recipe they find online, and the main character decides to take
the next day to attempt it. The next scene is supposed to portray
the following day, the character waking up in the morning and finding
a recipe online, then getting started. After a montage of various cooking
sounds, the character finishes up and invites their friend over. They
greet their friend, have them try their dish, and the scene
and narrative ends with their friend giving a lackluster
response to the dish.
