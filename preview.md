For my soundscape narrative preview, I have included about 30 seconds of what will
be the opening of the narrative. I layered different
street sounds such as chatter, sirens, honks,
and cars driving by to create the ambiance of a bustling
city. Overlaid on top of these backgrounds noises are footsteps
of a person walking down the street/sidewalk. The person is
about to enter a bodega to grab their breakfast on-the-go
before heading into work. This will comprise the first half of
the piece, and then the second half will be the scene of
a different person in a different place.
